# Population-Analysis-using-Power-BI

Used python to 
1) make formatting changes and merge columns
2) Transpose rows into columns
3) Rank the state/city based on population and sort them 
and write it into a new organised CSV file.

Designed an Animated Visualtization in Power BI to see the population shift between states in the US.
